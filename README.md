# Customize Search Engine

This is an extension to customize Safari's search engine.

It allows you to change to other search engines other than the default engines such as Google and Bing.

For example, you can change to a search engine such as Startpage, search within sites such as Wikipedia or GitHub, or use DeepL translation from the search bar.

## How to use

Enter the top and suffix of URL.

Example:

| Search Engine | Top of URL | Suffix of URL |
| ------------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| Google (Personalized Off) | https://www.google.com/search?q= | &pws=0 |
| Startpage (Safe Search Off) | https://www.startpage.com/sp/search?query= | &qadf=none |
| DeepL (to Japanese) | https://www.deepl.com/translator#en/ja/ |  |
